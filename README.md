# Sample Vulnerable Smart Contract And Corresponding Reentrance Attack

This project demonstrates a basic vulnerable Smart Contract. It comes with a vulnerable sample contract, a reentrance attack contract and test for the attack contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
